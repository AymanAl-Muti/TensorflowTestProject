# TensorflowTestProject
This was my first step into machine learning with Tensorflow and creating a project with it, all you have to do is run the main.py file.

In this game what you do is try to create a character from a bunch of different choices, and then the machine takes a guess as to how likely you'll survive! it guesses from a random test set that I generated and trained it with!


A youtube video show it working in case you cannot get it to run
